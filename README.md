Noonoo is a tiny project cleaner that help you to maintening a clear project. It can performed 3 tasks just for you:

- delete file which start, end or named by characters defined in conf file
- (not implemented) remove begin/end lines of specific files
- (not implemented) auto-indent your file and let you choose the indent stype

## Post-mortem

This project is descontinued because I think its pointless. However, I had a lot of fun to make it, I learn many about grep, awk, regex, and shell script. So, I just put it here by a kind of nostalgy.
